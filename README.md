# Big-data-processing-and-analysis

this is a repository about a course in szu called "Big data processing and analysis", which i think is a great course to learn Big data algorithm.
in this repository there are 7 experiments from "Big data Generate" to "Performance test of big data progressive fusion learning framework"

the complete inventory is shown below:

* exp1 Big data processing and analysis
* exp2 Disk fault detection method for distributed storage system
* exp3 Big data default interpolation method
* exp4 Generation and determination of random sample division of big data
* exp5 Big data dimensionality reduction method
* exp6 Big data probability density function estimation
* exp7 Performance test of big data progressive fusion learning framework

and i also write some blogs in site [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/np_hard/category_10946960.html?spm=1001.2014.3001.5482)(although it is not a good site to learn cs)


that's all, thank for those who have help me in learning big data!
